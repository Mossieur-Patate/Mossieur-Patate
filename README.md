I have absolutely no sympathy for Microsoft (which owns this place), I just joined to help with an addition to an open-source project (Raylib) that is not on GitLab (and may have to help others in the future, unless they migrate to another platform).  
By the way, I notice the section ‘Pronouns’; ‘Sex’ is more in line with basic reality. ;) I am male (‘Mossieur’ is childish French for ‘Mister’).  
‘Fun fact:’ this whole description, I guess. ;))
